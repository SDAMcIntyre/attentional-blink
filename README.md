Started git repository on 5 November 2014  with non-git AB_addNoise_QUEST2.py by Alex Holcombe

Main version **AB.py** includes optional noise staircase, finding noise level to titrate T1 approx correct to a particular level.

**ltrsNoiseQuestDemo.py** is a playground for how the noise and staircase work. 

Used in collaborations with Cellini, Mednick, McDevitt, & Goodbourn on sleep. Also Agosta, Battelli, & Goodbourn on left parietal lobe patients.
